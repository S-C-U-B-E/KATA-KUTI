# KATA-KUTI
Kata Kuti aka Tic-Tac-Toe.
My first Java Based Android Application built from scratch :D. 
This is a very simple app in it's core. 
But I've tried to handle all use cases possible.Such as how the notifications work, or most importantly the **Android Lifecycle** and 
several others like managing **Audio Services**.
I am very happy to complete this app ,enjoy the code ! 

So, overall this was a --**24days 90commits**-- full of fun and learning XD.. (and now a nice 4days sleep :P)

## Getting Started

I prefer to use Android Studio for building Android apps, there are other platforms too but Android Studio is the first choice when it comes to android development.

### Prerequisites

- Basic-to-Intermediate knowledge of Java/Kotlin. (  For now I use Java  ). 
- A basic understanding of how android works. ( There are tons of videos available out there )
- A VCS.. If your project can get big enough with time.. then best to use any VCS or Version Control System such as git. It will help you to manage your huge code base efficiently.
- At last an IDE to implement your idea..You can download Android Studio from the link below. Watch any YouTube video on how to start with android studio.. but i guess you can figure it out yourself.

## Acknowledgments

* Udacity - for two years now.. i've been doing courses on udacity.One of the best platform to learn stuff.I really like the way of their explanation about stuffs.
* Stackoverflow - facing any unknown error? don't worry stackoverflow got you covered XD.

## Tip for the beginners
- First try to learn how to build consistent layouts
- Try to know as much you can about Android Lifecycle.. before jumping into any big project. This is where you might get stuck frequently.
- Last.. Happy Coding!!!!
